# Lassare Slack Mode for Gemini CLI

description = "Switch to Slack mode - questions sent to your Slack DM, dangerous commands require Slack approval"
prompt = """
Switch to Slack mode by running this shell command:

```bash
.gemini/scripts/lassare-slack.sh
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Enable YOLO mode

Slack mode requires YOLO mode so the hook can gate dangerous commands via Slack.
**Remind the user to press Ctrl+Y to enable YOLO mode** (or launch with `gemini --yolo`).

## ⚠️ STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED

When in Slack mode, you MUST use the `ask` MCP tool for ALL communication:

✅ ALWAYS use Slack for:
- ANY question, clarification, or confirmation needed
- Task completion notifications (brief recap + "What's next?")
- Before making assumptions about unclear requirements
- When you're unsure about anything

❌ NEVER do these in Slack mode:
- Ask questions inline in the conversation
- Respond with inline text after receiving a Slack reply
- Assume the answer without asking
- Skip notification when completing significant work

🔄 IMPORTANT: Keep the conversation in Slack
When user replies via Slack, respond back via the `ask` MCP tool - never switch to inline text.

Format: Keep question short (<100 chars), put details in context parameter.
In the context field, use real line breaks for readability — NEVER use literal \\n characters.
