# Lassare Inline Mode for Gemini CLI

description = "Switch to inline mode - questions asked directly in conversation"
prompt = """
Switch to inline mode by running this shell command:

```bash
.gemini/scripts/lassare-inline.sh
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Disable YOLO mode

Inline mode works best without YOLO mode so Gemini CLI handles approvals natively.
**Remind the user to press Ctrl+Y to disable YOLO mode** if it's currently enabled.

If the user wants an extra safety net for dangerous commands (even with YOLO on),
they can enable the OS dialog with `/lassare-dialog-on`.

Ask questions directly in this conversation.
