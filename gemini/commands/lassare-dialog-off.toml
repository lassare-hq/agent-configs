Disable the inline approval dialog by running:

```bash
.gemini/scripts/lassare-dialog-off.sh
```

Confirm to the user: dangerous commands in inline mode will now be handled by Gemini CLI's native approval flow. **Remind them to disable YOLO mode (Ctrl+Y)** if they want Gemini to prompt before running dangerous commands.
